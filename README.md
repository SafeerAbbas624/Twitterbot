To use this code, you need to replace the placeholder values for YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY, YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET, YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN, and YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET with your own Twitter API credentials. You can obtain these credentials by creating a Twitter Developer account and creating a new Twitter App.

Save the above code in a Python file, and make sure you have installed the Tweepy library by running pip install tweepy in your command prompt or terminal.

Next, create a text file named tweets.txt in the same directory as the Python file, and enter one tweet per line.

Finally, run the Python file to send the tweets. The bot will read the tweets from the tweets.txt file and send them one by one from your Twitter account.

Note: Be sure to comply with Twitter's Developer Policy and Automation Rules when creating a Twitter bot. Sending mass tweets too frequently or spamming can lead to your account being suspended or terminated
